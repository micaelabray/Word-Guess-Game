Create a div with 8 rows, each col the width of the body col

Row 1 of Right column: “Press any key to get started” text

Row 2 of Right column: “Wins” text, plus a counter to the right to track wins

Row 3 of Right column: “Current word” text

Row 4 of Right column: Word from the array that starts with “_” instead of each letter and on a correct guess fills in the letter

Row 5 of Right column: “Number of guesses remaining” text

Row 6 of Right column: Give 10 guesses to start. On an incorrect letter, guesses will go down by 1. 

Row 7 of Right column: “Letters already guessed” text

Row 8 of Right column: Once an incorrect letter has been guessed, it appears below row 7 to show it has already been used. Make sure that pressing a letter more than once will not cause guesses to diminish. 

Once the word has been solved, restart to pick a new word and recover the letters.



JavaScript:
Create an array with the words that you are wanting to add into the game

Randomize the array using Math.random 

For each letter, give it the value of an underscore until the letter is selected on the keyboard

Once the letter is selected, give the value of that letter back to the word

If you select an incorrect letter, guesses total will go down and the letter will appear in the "Letters already guessed" text field.
